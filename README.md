## About the Video Course
30% of data mining vacancies also involve machine learning. And those that do are 30% better paid than the rest. If youâ€™re involved in data mining you need to get on top of machine learning, before it gets on top of you.

Hands-On Machine Learning for Data Mining gives you everything you need to bring the power of machine learning into your data mining work. This video course will enable you to pair the best algorithms with the right tools and processes. You will see how systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make predictions on data with minimal human intervention.
